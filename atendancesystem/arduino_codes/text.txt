Unlock Workforce Productivity and Accountability with Intelligent Attendance Monitoring

Attendance monitoring is essential for optimizing workforce productivity and accountability. 
By tracking employee presence, organizations can gain insights to enhance efficiency, 
ensure fair policies, and empower employees. 
Effective attendance tracking enables data-driven decision making, 
streamlined payroll, 
and elevated organizational performance.

Tracking student attendance is key for academic success. 
Automated systems record presence, tardiness, 
and absences, allowing educators to identify patterns and provide targeted support. 
When students know their attendance is monitored,
 they are more likely to prioritize being in class,
 boosting learning outcomes and graduation rates.


 <h1>Current Date and Time</h1>
  <p id="datetime"></p>

  <script>
    // Get the current date and time
    const currentDate = new Date();

    // Extract the day, date, month, and time
    const day = currentDate.getDay();
    const date = currentDate.getDate();
    const month = currentDate.getMonth() + 1; // Months are zero-indexed, so we add 1
    const hours = currentDate.getHours();
    const minutes = currentDate.getMinutes();
    const seconds = currentDate.getSeconds();

    // Define an array of day names
    const dayNames = ['Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday'];

    // Get the day name
    const dayName = dayNames[day];

    // Create the datetime string
    const datetimeString = `Today is ${dayName}, ${date}/${month}, and the time is ${hours}:${minutes}:${seconds}`;

    // Display the datetime string in the HTML
    document.getElementById('datetime').textContent = datetimeString;
